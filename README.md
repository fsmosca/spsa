# Optimizer for games

Optimizer for game coefficients using the SPSA algorithm.
Author: StÃ©phane Nicolet

### Installation
* On windows
  * Install python 3.8 from https://www.python.org/downloads/  
  * Install requirements.txt  
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  * Download this repo as it already contains sample engines and cutechess-cli tourney manager.  
  Press `Clone->Download ZIP` at the top-right of this page.
  * Edit optimizer_setting.yml with notepad or notepad++ to set the engine and cutechess options.
  * Run the optimizer
  `python game_optimizer.py iteration 10000`

### Usage:  
`python game_optimizer.py --iteration 1000`

### List of files in the directory ###

- *game_optimizer.py* : the main file of the package
- *spsa.py* : a general-purpose minimization algorithm (an improved version of the SPSA algorithm)
- *utils.py* : small utility functions
- *match.py* : a script to organize a match between two playing engines in any game (Go, Chess, etc..)
- *chess_game.py* : organize one game of Chess between two engines. Can be plugged into *match.py*
- *chess_match.py* : a specialized Chess version of *match.py*, more efficient because it uses parallelism for the match
