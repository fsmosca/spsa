Optimizer for game coefficients using the SPSA algorithm.
Author: StÃ©phane Nicolet

### A. Installation
* On windows
  * Install python 3.8 from https://www.python.org/downloads/  
  * Install requirements.txt  
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  * Download this repo as it already contains sample engines and cutechess-cli tourney manager.  
  Press `Clone->Download ZIP` at the top-right of this page.
  * Edit optimizer_setting.yml with notepad or notepad++ to set the engine and cutechess options.
  * Run the optimizer
  `python game_optimizer.py`

### B. Usage:  
`python game_optimizer.py`

#### Save console output to file testlog.txt in windows 10 powershell
`python -u game_optimizer.py | tee testlog.txt`

#### Limit iteration to 1000
`python game_optimizer.py --iteration 1000`

#### Add another stopping rule if goal is good (all mean goal <= option_value) and minimum iter is meet.
`python game_optimizer.py --stop-all-mean-goal -0.75 --stop-min-iter 200`  

For optimizer the goal is to maximize the score of test_engine vs base_engine in a match of 4 games or so. The optimizer will vary the value of the parameter (say queenvalue 650) to be optimized which will be used by test_engine. It will then match with base_engine at say fast time control of 5s+50ms. If test_engine scored 1/4 or 1.0 point out of 4 games, the score is 0.25 for test_engine and this is bad because it is below 0.5 or 50%. This score is then reported to the optimizer as -(actual match score of test_engine) or -0.25 that is (negate the actual match score because the optimizer will minimize it). The minimum of optimizer is -1.0, so from -0.25 it will attempt to have -0.5, -0.75 and so on. The minimum of optimizer is a maximum score of the test_engine. 
After some calculations the optimizer will suggest a new parameter values say queenvalue 700, to try next vs the base_engine. An iteration is completed after the score is received. Optimizer saves every score or goal in every iteration, it will then calculate the mean or average of it in the last 30 iterations. If this mean goal is equal or below `--stop-all-mean-goal` and the iterations is already equal or more than the `--stop-min-iter` then the optimizer is stopped.

### C. Sample Optimization scenario
#### Computer with 8 threads
* Computer has 8 threads, either from 4 cores and 8 threads or 8 cores.
* You can use 4 threads for optimization, leave the other 4 threads for personal use.
* This optimizer needs to run 2 matches per iteration.
* In optimizer_setting.yml for cutechess section, set concurrency to 2 because 4 threads/2 is 2.
* So for match 1, set games per encounter to 2, set rounds to 2 set repeat to 2,  
that would generate 4 games from 2 games per encounter x 2 rounds. With concurrency of 2,  
2 games will be started automatically by cutechess.
* Meanwhile match 2 also starts with same conditions as in match 1. Match 1 and Match 2 will be run  
in parallel starting at iteration 2.
* Overall there are 8 games to be completed in every iteration in this setup.
* In both match 1 and 2, it is better to have more games so that the optimizer can give better prediction  
of optimal parameter values that will be tried in the next iteration. If you want 8 games in match 1 and 8  
games in match 2, just increase the number of rounds to 4, that is from 2 games per encounter x 4 rounds equals 8 games.

#### Computer with 16 threads
* You may use 12 threads for optimization.
* Set concurrency of cutechess to 6, match 1 will use 6 and match 2 will use 6 too.
* If you want 6 games in match 1 and 6 games in match 2, set games per encounter to 2 and set rounds to 3.  
6 games will be started by cutechess concurrently for match 1 and in parallel, 6 games will be started by cutechess for match 2.

### D. List of files in the directory ###

- *game_optimizer.py* : the main file of the package
- *spsa.py* : a general-purpose minimization algorithm (an improved version of the SPSA algorithm)
- *utils.py* : small utility functions
- *match.py* : a script to organize a match between two playing engines in any game (Go, Chess, etc..)
- *chess_game.py* : organize one game of Chess between two engines. Can be plugged into *match.py*
- *chess_match.py* : a specialized Chess version of *match.py*, more efficient because it uses parallelism for the match
