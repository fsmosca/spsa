# Optimizer for games

Optimizer for game coefficients using the SPSA algorithm.
Author: St√©phane Nicolet

Usage : *python game-optimizer.py --iteration 1000 --param "queenvalue 1000 800 1200 1000, rookvalue 500 450 600 1000"*  
1000 is the value  
800 is the min  
1200 is the max  
1000 is the factor, used to control the input number to optimizer. value/factor = 1000/1000 = 1 will be sent to optimizer. If the parameter is not sensitive to changes, increase the factor.

### List of files in the directory ###

- *game_optimizer.py* : the main file of the package
- *spsa.py* : a general-purpose minimization algorithm (an improved version of the SPSA algorithm)
- *utils.py* : small utility functions
- *match.py* : a script to organize a match between two playing engines in any game (Go, Chess, etc..)
- *chess-game.py* : organize one game of Chess between two engines. Can be plugged into *match.py*
- *chess-match.py* : a specialized Chess version of *match.py*, more efficient because it uses parallelism for the match
